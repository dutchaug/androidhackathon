<p>Just before DroidconNL 2013 the GDG Dutch Android User Group, is hosting a hackathon for Android developers and designers.</p>

<p>This year&#39;s theme will be <strong>&#39;You can hack, but you can&#39;t hide! The smart (watch) way&#39;</strong>.
During this hackathon we will expect about twelve teams, each consisting of two Android developers and one designer, 
to create some awesome apps and competing for the first place.</p>

<p>From the theme you can read we are hacking away at smart watches! Smart watches have become more and more popular. 
All major Android hardware manufacturers already have, or are working on their own smart watch. 
So how cool is it to hack on a smart watch with Android?</p>

<p>Good news, thanks to our <a href="/#/sponsors">sponsors</a> we have been able to procure a limited amount of Sony and I&#39;m Watch 
smart watches which we can use to make awesome Android apps.</p>

<p>More info on this hackathon can be found <a href="/#/current">here</a>.</p>
