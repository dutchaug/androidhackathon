	    What would communities like ours be without our sponsors.  
	    The companies below believe in who we are and what we do. Thanks to these sponsors, we 
	    are able to spice the hackathon up with some excellent SmartWatches. They allow
	    the teams to experiment with their devices and really get to know their SDK's.
